<p>Luna is written in Perl and was created by Lynx with some help from some good friends like Lake<p>
<p>Originally named "Katana", Luna's development came to place late 2014</p>
<p>The Project was then shutdown for a few months and later brought back early 2015 and renamed to Luna<p>
<p>Luna provides great stability, security and comes packed with features</p>
<p>Not only is Luna the best AS2 source to exist, but its the only source that has almost everything working</p>
<p>It is also the only source with active development and that was built using only a smartphone</p>
